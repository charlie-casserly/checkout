# Notes from candidate

Hello Engineers at StudentBeans!

Here is my tech test submission for the Backend Engineer role. I have really enjoyed this test and I hope that my solution is worthy of your approval!
I made the decision to add some methods into the Database class just to make it a better representation of an actual database. I have also tried to keep my commit messages as detailed as possible and have committed regularly. I hope this is all okay!

Have a wonderful weekend!
